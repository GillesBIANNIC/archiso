# archiso
This is my own archiso config to create an iso with what I want.  
It's my personnal config, but you can use and fork it !

## The base :
I want to have an iso with a light graphical interface : I chose 'i3'.  
For friendly CLI : I use 'zsh' with 'oh-my-zsh' (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).  

## Tools :
I will integrate some tools in differents branchs.
